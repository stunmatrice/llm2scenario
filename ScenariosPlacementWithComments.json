            "description": "The ego vehicle is approaching an intersection approximately 200 meters ahead. On the right side of the road, a group of pedestrians in the plaza are successively heading toward the crosswalk at the traffic light. As the ego vehicle continues straight toward the intersection, it comes to a stop and waits for the pedestrian flow to pass through the crosswalk before proceeding across the intersection.",
